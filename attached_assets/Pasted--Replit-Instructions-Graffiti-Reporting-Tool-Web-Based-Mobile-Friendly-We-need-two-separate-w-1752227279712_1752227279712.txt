üõ†Ô∏è Replit Instructions: Graffiti Reporting Tool (Web-Based, Mobile-Friendly)
We need two separate web-based tools:

üîπ App 1: Public Reporting Form for Users
Goal:
Build a simple mobile-optimized web page that users can open via a QR code, and use to report graffiti or vandalism from their current location.

‚úÖ Features:
Image Upload:

Allow the user to upload or take one or more photos using their phone‚Äôs camera.

Accept image files (jpg/png).

Location Detection and Map Preview:

Detect the user's current location using browser geolocation.

Show the user‚Äôs location on an interactive map (using Leaflet or Google Maps).

Save coordinates (latitude and longitude).

District/Neighborhood Selection:

Dropdown menu with predefined list of city districts or neighborhoods.

Free Text Description:

A text area where users can describe the case in more detail (e.g., ‚ÄúOn the side of the electrical box near the park‚Äù).

Optional Contact Information:

Optional input field for phone number or email.

Contact info will not be required and the report can remain anonymous.

Used only for sending status updates if the city takes action on the reported case.

Submit Button:

Sends all form data (images, location, district, description, optional contact info, timestamp) to a backend system.

In the prototype, data can be sent to a webhook.site link or to Firebase/Google Sheets.

Thank You Message After Submission:

Example: ‚ÄúThank you for your report! It helps us keep the city clean.‚Äù

üîß Technical Notes:
Use Replit with HTML / CSS / JS project.

Must be mobile-friendly/responsive.

No login or authentication required.

Ready to be linked via a QR code.

First, test with webhook.site, and later connect to a proper backend (e.g., Firebase or Google Sheets).

üîπ App 2: Private Admin Dashboard for Internal Use
Goal:
Create a private dashboard to view and manage all reported cases. This tool is not public and is for internal/city/commercial use only.

‚úÖ Features:
Map View:

Show all reported graffiti cases on a map (Leaflet or Google Maps).

Each marker shows:

Submitted photo(s)

Timestamp

Description

Selected district

Contact info (if given)

Table/List View:

Show all reports in a scrollable list or table format.

Include sorting/filtering by time, district, or status.

Report Status Tracking (Basic):

Allow manually updating the status of each report, e.g., "New", "In Progress", "Cleaned".

Data Source:

Pull data from the same backend used by the public form (e.g., Firebase, Google Sheets, etc.).

üß© Future Add-ons (not needed now):
Contractor bidding tool

Graffiti reappearance tracking (same location reporting)

Cleaning budget planning tools

Status update emails/SMS to reporters

Public API for cleaning partners

‚ú® Primary Goals for Now:
Public reporting form must be very simple and fast to use on mobile

No installation or login required

Works via QR code link

Saves all needed data for internal processing

Admin tool shows reports on a map and list for internal use
